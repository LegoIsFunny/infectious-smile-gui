# infectious-smile-gui
A GUI script for the game "Infectious Smile" on Roblox. Can delete no-fly scripts and more.
Obfuscated but not slow.

## Quick Notes

* If you are confused about it saying "Vaporsploit", thats a pseudonym I use.

* If you are in the ground when you respawn after flying, simple press "fly" again.

## Credits:
This script uses an open source gui known as material lua. If you want to easily make a GUI, go to materiallua.ml
