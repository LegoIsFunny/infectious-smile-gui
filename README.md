# infectious-smile-gui
A GUI script for the game "Infectious Smile" on Roblox. Can delete no-fly scripts and more.
Obfuscated cause why not?

## Quick Note
If you are confused about it saying "Vaporsploit", thats a pseudonym I use.

## Credits:
This script uses an open source gui known as material lua. If you want to easily make a GUI, go to materiallua.ml
